# web-scrapping

In this project, I have extracted data from the youtube for different categories using the chromedriver extension and selenium module in python. I have performed a machine learning classification approach to check accuracy of the extracted data i.e titles and video description.

>Note: 
We have to load the youtube page manually by scrolling down as much as we can in order to extract more data from more number of videos.
